# 🌐 Networking to TLS — Independent Study Repository

Welcome to my **Networking to TLS Learning Repository**!  
This project documents my personal learning journey — from the **basics of computer networking** all the way to understanding **Transport Layer Security (TLS)** and modern Internet communication.

---

## 🎯 Purpose

This repository is designed as a **self-paced study workbook** that combines:
- 📘 **Structured notes** (in Markdown)  
- 🖊 **Handwritten diagrams & practice tasks**  
- 💻 **Obsidian-style linked learning**  

It helps me (and anyone following along) to:
- Build a strong foundation in **networking fundamentals**
- Understand key security principles
- Master TLS concepts through step-by-step exploration

---


## 🧠 Learning Approach

I use a **hybrid note-taking system**:
- ✍️ **Handwritten Notes:** for diagrams and layer visualization  
- 💾 **Digital Notes (Markdown):** for summaries and tables  
- 🔗 **Obsidian:** to interlink concepts like `[[OSI Layers]]` or `[[HTTPS Basics]]`

## 📚 Topics Covered

| Stage | Focus Area | Key Concepts |
|-------|-------------|---------------|
| **1** | Networking Fundamentals | LAN, WAN, IP, OSI, TCP/IP, HTTP |

## 🤖 Credits & Tools

This repository was created as part of my independent study on **Networking and TLS**.  
Some structure, formatting, and summaries were generated with the assistance of **OpenAI’s GPT-5**, then reviewed and customized by me.  
All handwritten notes, reflections, and diagrams are my own.
