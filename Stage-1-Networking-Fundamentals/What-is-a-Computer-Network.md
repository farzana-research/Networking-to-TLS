## 📘 Summary

A **computer network** is a system that connects two or more computers or devices to **share data, resources, and services**.  
Connections can be made through **wired media** (Ethernet, fiber optics) or **wireless signals** (Wi-Fi, radio).  
Networks can range from small **LANs (Local Area Networks)** to large **WANs (Wide Area Networks)** — including the **Internet**.

At its core, a network allows communication and resource sharing between users and systems.  
Whether you’re **sending an email**, **streaming a video**, or **accessing a remote server**, networking makes it possible.

## 🕰️ Background

- **1960s:** The idea of computer networking began with **ARPANET**, funded by the U.S. Department of Defense.  
- ARPANET was created to let research institutions exchange data quickly and reliably.  
- It became the foundation of today’s **Internet**, the world’s largest and most complex network.

## 🧩 Key Concepts

| Concept | Description |
|----------|--------------|
| **Communication** | Enables real-time and delayed exchange via email, web, or messaging. |
| **Resource Sharing** | Devices (printers, scanners) and applications are accessible by multiple users. |
| **Data Management** | Centralized or distributed storage improves security and backups. |
| **Remote Access** | Users can log in from any location — supports remote work. |
| **Continuous Evolution** | Networks constantly upgrade with new hardware, software, and services. |

## 💻 Examples of Networks

- Home Wi-Fi (LAN)  
- University Campus Network (MAN)  
- Global Internet (WAN)  
- Corporate Intranet  

---

## 🧰 Practical Uses

- Sharing hardware resources (printers, drives)  
- Collaboration on shared data or applications  
- Communication through web, email, and video calls  
- Centralized data backup and management  
- Remote login to servers or cloud services

## 💭 Reflection

> Networks form the **foundation of modern communication**.  
> They are the invisible systems that make the Internet, cloud computing, and remote work possible.
